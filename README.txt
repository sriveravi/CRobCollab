To annotate images, see function below for an example:

    ShapeMarker/example1_Marking.m

To load eye tracking data for analysis, you need to first run edf2asc (part of eyelink display software)
    in order to convert the .edf file to a text file.  I run it without samples, makes text file MUCH
    smaller and process much faster.  Then see:

    example2_Analysis.m
