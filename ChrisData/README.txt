This should be organized a bit differently but the analysis scripts look in these folders so I prefer not to change the structure too much.


Immediate recognition
- This directory organizes the immediate recognition data.

Spore Same/Different Study
- The spore same/different task data are stored in the "SporeStudy" folder.
